== Welcome to Offers project

This is a project that does some of the functionalities of offers webpages like Groupon or Groupalia. 
I haven't tried to do the same thing than this webpages because this is a project to show how to use
some ruby on rails skills.

In this project we have users, some of them can create venues and offers linked to these venues. Then 
users can comment this offers.

This is a Rails web-application that includes user management with devise, migrations, before_filter,
ajax, scopes, intermediate tables, validations, CSS, HTML, paperclip, database relationships, roles 
with cancan gem,...

I also avoid to send all js and css files in all requests and I have started with internationalization
(english and spanish). I haven't translated everything because it is a sample of how to use it. 

In the seed file I have created 3 users with different roles and two venues by default.

There are three kind of roles:
	- User: they can't create offers
	- Venue: they can create offers
	- Admin: full access

I will be improve the code little by little and I will be adding more functionalities.
